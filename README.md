# A4R-Freight-Train-Model-Geometries
Repository of rappresentative surface geometries of locomotives and common freight wagons for CFD use
The origin of the frame of reference of all geometries is situated in the center of the track, on top of the rail at the leading edge of the wagon plane (excluding the repellers).
-  The x axis points in the direction of motion;
-  the y axis is horizontal, pointing to the right according to an observer that is facing the direction of motion;
-  the z axis is vertical, oriented so as to make a right-handed frame of reference (pointing down).

Geometries of the single parts that make up a complete wagon or locomotive are available in different levels of detail for custom geometries, full wagons and locomotives are also available.
